What is Ansible?
Ansible is an automation and orchestration tool popular for its simplicity of installation.
Ansible functions by connecting via SSH to the clients, so it doesn't need a special agent on the client-side, and by pushing modules to the clients.
The modules are then executed locally, on the client-side, and the output is pushed back to the Ansible server.
Client details, like hostnames or IP addresses and SSH ports, are stored in files called inventory files. Once you have created an inventory file and populated it, ansible can use it.


Why do we need ansible??
Because of IDEMPOTENCE it is consistant

Important terms used in Ansible:
Ansible server:
The machine where Ansible is installed and from which all tasks and playbooks will run

Module:
Basically, a module is a command or set of similar commands meant to be executed on the client-side

Task:
A task is a section that consists of a single procedure to be completed

Role:
A way of organizing tasks and related files to be later called in a playbook

Fact:
Information fetched from the client system from the global variables with the gather-facts operation

Inventory:
File containing data about the ansible client servers. Defined in later examples as hosts file

Play:
Execution of a playbook

Handler:
Task which is called only if a notifier is present

Notifier:
Section attributed to a task which calls a handler if the output is changed

Tag:
Name set to a task which can be used later on to issue just that specific task or group of tasks.

Install ansible on Ubuntu/Debian systems
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install software-properties-common
$ sudo apt-add-repository ppa:ansible/ansible
$ sudo apt update
$ sudo apt install ansible

Ansible Host configuration
Configure SSH access to the server
Next, we need to make it possible for our node to access the Ansible server. We do this via Secure Shell (SSH). 

Setting up our node
sudo nano /etc/ansible/hosts

NOTE:
The default location for the inventory file is /etc/ansible/hosts, but itâ€™s also possible to change the location of the inventory file by uncommenting the inventory parameter in /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg

In that file, create a new group for your nodes (in our case, we've only connected one node) and associate the IP addresses like so:

[group_name]
ALIAS NODE_IP
Where group_name is the name of the group to be created, ALIAS is an alias for the node, and NODE_IP is the IP address of your node. If you have more than one node, list them like so:

[webservers]
WEB1@192.168.1.100
WEB2@192.168.1.101
WEB3@192.168.1.102
Save and close that file. You can now test this by pinging all of your added nodes with the command:
ansible -m ping all


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The machine where the IAC software installed is typically called as server 

Ansible works on push model bascilly server communitates with node 
In pull model there is nessaity for agent to be installed on node

SAMPLE COMMAND TO INSTALL APACHE2 IN ALL THE NODES PRESENT IN GROUP
ansible testserver -b --become-user=root -m shell -a 'apt-get install apache2 -y' -u USER

-----------------------------
command to check number of modules in ansible 
ansible-doc -l | wc -l

What is inventory?
it is nothing but list of nodes that we want to manage 

What is a playbook?
